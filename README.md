This repository configuration is intended to make ONLYOFFICE installation process easier and avoid entering several commands, replacing them with a single one.

Instead of adding GPG key and creating the `onlyoffice.repo` file manually, use the following command to add ONLYOFFICE repository on CentOS and derivatives

```
sudo yum install http://download.onlyoffice.com/repo/centos/main/noarch/onlyoffice-repo.noarch.rpm
```

After that you can continue ONLYOFFICE installation, as described here:
